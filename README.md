# TourGuide
The "Tour Guide App" is the third project of Udacity's Android Developer Nanodegree

## Project Overview
The final project is a chance for you to combine and practice everything you learned in this section of the Nanodegree program. You will be making your own multi-screen Android app to share your knowledge about a city you are very familiar with.

The goal is to create a Tour Guide App which presents relevant information to a user who’s visiting your city. The app can list top attractions, restaurants, public places, or events for the city. It can contain all the best known secrets that only locals know. It’s up to you which categories you want to provide, as well as what information to provide in each category.

## Why this project?
In the most recent portion of the Nanodegree program, you worked to build the Miwok language app, which taught you how to present information in a multi-screen app to your users. Now, you will practice that skillset by presenting information that you care about in your own life to a user. Your Tour Guide app will be unique to your city, your life, and your interests.

## What will I learn?
This project is about combining various ideas and skills we’ve been practicing throughout the course. They include:

Planning your app design and navigation before coding
Selecting proper data structures to store lists of information
Building layouts to display those lists of data
Navigating between lists in Fragments using either a ViewPager plus TabLayout or Navigation Drawer*
Creating your own custom classes
Properly handling images or audio (if applicable)
* Navigation Drawers were not covered in this course, but you may choose to implement it in this app.

### Note: As the focus of this program is Java, only projects completed with Java as the source code will be accepted. Projects using Kotlin as the source code will not be accepted.

## Build Your Project
For this project, you'll be making a Tour Guide app. This is an app with multiple screens, each of which lists a kind of attraction for a given city, national park, or historical monument. For instance, an app focused on Mountain View, CA might include a list of startup headquarters as well as a list of restaurants and a list of parks.

Once you've decided on the location you'd like to show off, you'll want to build the structure of your app. Using the skills from the Miwok app, you'll make multiple screens, each containing a list. You will use a ViewPager plus TabLayout (or Navigation Drawer) combined with Fragments to move between screens.

Next, you'll fill in those lists with list items, populated using a custom adapter. It may make sense for some lists to include information such as a phone number or business hours, but for others it may make more sense to have a photograph. Design your adapter based on the information you would like to show.

If you need help generating bitmaps for your project, refer back to the Generating Your Own Bitmaps concept.

Your project will be evaluated using the Tour Guide App project rubric.
